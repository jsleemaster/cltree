Claude Explorer is a terminal-based helper for Claude Code CLI. It presents a split-pane TUI: Claude Code on the left, and a file tree on the right.

## Behavior

- Split-pane layout with Claude Code on the left and the file tree on the right
- When Claude Code moves to a different folder, the tree updates to show that directory

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start in current directory
claude-explorer

# Start in specific directory
claude-explorer --path /path/to/project
```
